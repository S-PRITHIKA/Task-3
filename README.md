 ✨ Glow and Glam – Stage 3

This repository contains the third stage task of my internship project Glow and Glam.
It is built using React + Vite for fast development and smooth performance, with ESLint configured for clean and consistent code.

 🔧 Tech Stack

* ⚡ Vite – Next-generation frontend build tool
* ⚛️ React – For building interactive UIs
* 🔥 Fast Refresh – Instant updates while coding
* ✅ ESLint – Pre-configured linting for code quality

 📦 React Plugins

The project can use either of the following official plugins for React:

 [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) → Uses Babel for Fast Refresh
 [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) → Uses SWC (faster alternative to Babel)
